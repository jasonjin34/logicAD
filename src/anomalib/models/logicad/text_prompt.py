1. Each line consists of only one piece of fact.\n
2. Predicates are named in terms of properties such as location, color, size etc. Connect words with underline. Use lowercases only.\n
3. Objects and quantities are given as arguments of the predicates (use * if the object is uncountable or the number is irrelevant). Connect words with underline and always use singular form\n
4. Logical connectives such as $AND$, $OR$ $NOT$ might be used.
