e juice is yellow, and the fruit is orange. The juice is filled to around half of the neck in the bottle. There are two stickers on the bottle, one on the top and one on the bottom. The top sticker is correct, as it features a square sticker with an orange fruit in the middle of the label. The bottom sticker is also correct, as it reads "100% juice" and is located horizontally centered in the bottom of the bottle. The bottle is symmetrically placed in the image.
